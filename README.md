#  Project Description: Translational Trajectories of German Fiction in the German and Austrian National Libraries

Who are the most translated authors of German fiction that we can find in Germanophone national collections? And how can DH tools be applied to account for the presence of an author in a national library and their absence in translation? The first question arose while conducting my PhD research project, in which I explored the premise that translations are not only invisible in library catalog data but also marginal in terms of available datasets and models of analysis in DH. I found that there is a persisting absence of translation data as well as studies that address the relationship between authors that are representative in a national canon yet absent in translation. Even though national libraries contain large repositories of bibliographic data on translations and their authors, publishers, and translators, we lack a database and tools to extract, link, and analyze translations across libraries. During my fellowship, I will test my method of finding and extracting bibliographic data on translations of works originally published in German from the Austrian National Library (ONB) to then curate a database of literary transfer. Next, I will design a model for visualizing and analyzing the overlaps and literary flows between the German and Austrian National Library. By visualizing the over- and underrepresented authors in the network of literary exchange between Germanophone countries, my project highlights the common grounds and points of divergence of these literary communities.

This project has been made possible by means of the CLSINFRA fellowship program at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 2024-June 2024.


# Dataset scope

The aim is to extract all translations of German fiction (all editions that have German marked as an original language, meaning the language of the original text). How many translations have been collected by the ONB is not known.
Preliminary tests have shown that the ONB only has a very limited amount of translations of German fiction as compared to the DNB. The ONB for instance does not have a single translation of Patrick SÃ¼skind. It does, however, have some of Kafka's translations. It is therefore necessary to both extract translations from the ONB and afterwards compare them to the "Mapping German fiction in translation" dataset extracted from the DNB.

The final dataset will consist of three tables (CSV):
**editions with original language German in the ONB
**editions that appear in both the ONB and DNB
**authority files for the matched authors in the ONB and DNB sub-datasets

# Data source and extraction

The data source of the primary dataset is the ONB catalogue. Via SRU a query will be designed to extract each record that has German as an original language. The MARC field #41 will be used for original language.
Since the ONB's SRU connection to extract data uses the Alma cataloguing system, the mapping has to be taken into account, e.g. which field in Alma corresponds to MARC #41.
